There's a change of venue for the March meeting (because Redwood Cafe
has live music on the 12th). The meeting will be at Flagship Taproom,
just up the street:

[Flagship Taproom](https://www.flagshiptaproom.com/cotati)<br>
8099 La Plaza St, Cotati

Still at 7pm on March 12.

We'll probably sit in Flaghip's outdoor space. It's covered, but it
will likely be a little chilly. Dress accordingly!
