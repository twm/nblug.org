The August NBLUG meeting will be Tuesday August 13. We're going to do
something a little different: Scott Larson has generously booked the
CoLab Presentation Lab for us. He's going to demo Obsidian:

> [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a modular PKM tool that you can
> adapt to the specific way you think. I'm using Obsidian to organize
> projects, track my progress with jobs, write articles and stories.
>
> Before I started using Obsidian, I used this note taking app for the
> iOS device called "Editorial". I really like it because you could
> code templates that fit your specific needs. With templates, you can
> create notes with pre-filled information reducing redundant
> keystrokes during the creation of a new note and during the note
> taking process.
>
> Eventually the developer stopped supporting it and I started to have
> problems with it as the OS went through its iterations. I reached
> out to this news site I frequent "Hacker News" and one commenter
> suggested Obsidian for a replacement.
>
> It's been over a year now and I'm using for everything I do in my
> day to day work and creative life.  I thought maybe this might be of
> interest to some people and I also realized that not many people
> know about it.

And Tom Most will give a quick demo of the screenshot tool Flameshot.

The demos will run 7-8pm at CoLab:

CoLab<br>
427 Mendocino Ave., Suite 100<br>
Santa Rosa, CA 95401

The door will be locked, so Scott will need to let people in.
Text him at 707-416-5811 when you arrive.

After the demo (around 8pm), we'll head around the corner to Flagship
Taproom Santa Rosa:

Flagship Taproom Santa Rosa<br>
446 B St.<br>
Santa Rosa, CA

This is a sister location of the Flagship in Cotati.
Don't go to Cotati!

See you there,
