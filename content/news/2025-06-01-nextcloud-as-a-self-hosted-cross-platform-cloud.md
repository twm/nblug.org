For June we have a talk!
Kyle Rankin will be presenting “Nextcloud as a Self-Hosted Cross-Platform Cloud”:

> Using someone else's cloud to sync photos, calendars and contacts?
> Proprietary services like iCloud are convenient, but only if you are in the
> Apple ecosystem. You can get many of the same basic cloud features in a
> self-hosted Nextcloud instance and sync files, calendars, and contacts on
> Linux, Mac and mobile devices. This talk discusses how to set up Nextcloud
> and configure Linux and Mac desktops and iOS mobile devices to use it,
> especially convenient if your household isn't 100% Linux (or 100% Mac).

The meeting will be Tuesday, June 10th at 7:00pm, at Flagship Taproom:
