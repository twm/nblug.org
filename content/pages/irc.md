### IRC

IRC is Internet Relay Chat,
and is what people used to communicate with text and keyboards through the Internet in real-time before Telegram, Discord, and ICQ existed.
It's a standard protocol, so there are many client applications and networks to connect to.

The official NBLUG IRC channel is #nblug on the network [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/),
where several members will often hang-out and generate idle-time.
Many of the members will join this channel (room) and leave a session logged-in even when they are away from their computer.
Occasionally, someone will check to see if anything has changed, and may choose to chat.

To connect to the channel you'll need a client.
The easiest way to get started is with Libera's [web client](https://web.libera.chat/).
Libera also has a [guide on choosing a client](https://libera.chat/guides/clients).

If you join and say hello, only to find silence,
try waiting around for a while and see if anyone else joins or responds.
